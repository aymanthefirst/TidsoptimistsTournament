Once you have added all the participants, click the "Done" button to start the tournament. The app will automatically create the first round, and you can begin the matches. After each round, click the "Next Round" button to generate the next round.

If you need to add more participants after the tournament has started, you can do so by clicking the "Add More Players" button at any time. You can also go back to a previous round by clicking the "Back" button.
